# üìä Data Analysis - Description:
<p align="justify">
  This repository contains the statistical analysis of the data collected during my research for my bachelor's thesis entitled "<b>Gendered UI/UX: A Comparative Study
  of Gender-Specific and Gender-Neutral Web Design</b>‚Äù. My thesis is a research project that explores the impact of gender on users UI/UX design preferences. 
  The topic is approached through a comparative study which led to the conclusion that gender, as a demographic characteristic,
  does indeed have an influence on the user‚Äôs overall perception and preferences regarding the design of a digital product. The study was conducted 
  through a questionnaire survey and the respondents who participated in it consisted of 122 women and 106 men in Greece. 
  <br/>
  At first, participants had to interact with three versions (male, female, and neutral) of a productivity app that I developed in React JS and then 
  answer the questionnaires, expressing their personal opinion on the design aspect of each version. The question types were mainly related to the rating 
  of various design aspects (using a five-point Likert scale) and participants‚Äô design preferences among the versions. Therefore, this notebook presents 
  the analysis of all the answers collected and contains:
  <ul>
    <li>An inspection of participants‚Äô demographic characteristics.</li>
    <li>A visualization of participants‚Äô preferences among various design aspects per version.</li>
    <li>A visualization of participants‚Äô ratings per version and its corresponding design aspects.</li>
    <li>A statistical significance testing of numeric data (by conducting Welch‚Äôs t-test).</li>
    <li>A statistical hypothesis testing for independence between categorical variables (by conducting Pearson‚Äôs chi square test).</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Libraries used:</b> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy <br/>
  <b>Important note:</b> It is worth noting that the participants were divided into two groups, where the first group was aware of the intended gender for each version, as opposed to the second group, which did not possess this information.
